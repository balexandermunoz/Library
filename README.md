# Library
Personal library created with HTML, CSS and JS.   
100% responsive and functional 📱 💻 🖥️.    

You can add many books and count how many pages you have, as well as the number of books and the different authors. At any time you can click on the green/red text that says "read/not read" and change the status. Note that this will affect the number of pages read. You can also delete your books at any time by clicking on the red X.
